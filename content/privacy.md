Meatup.Club respects your privacy. This page explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Information we collect

- Account details: name, email address, and profile photo from Google OAuth.
- Event participation: RSVPs, comments, and other meetup activity.
- SMS details: mobile number and SMS consent status if you opt in.
- Technical data: basic logs and session data required to operate the site.

## How we use information

- Provide and operate the Meatup.Club service.
- Send event-related notifications (email and SMS, if you opt in).
- Maintain account security and prevent abuse.
- Improve the product and community experience.

## SMS consent and opt-out

If you opt in to SMS reminders, we will send event reminders and allow you to reply YES or NO to update your RSVP. Message frequency is low (typically a couple of reminders per event).

- Reply STOP to opt out of SMS at any time.
- Reply HELP for instructions.
- Message and data rates may apply.

We store your phone number and consent status, but we do not store SMS message content.

## Sharing and vendors

We do not sell your personal information. We share limited data with vendors that help us operate the service, such as:

- Google OAuth (authentication)
- Cloudflare (hosting and database)
- Resend (email delivery)
- Twilio (SMS delivery)

These providers process data only to deliver their services.

## Cookies

We use essential cookies for login sessions and security. We do not use advertising trackers.

## Data retention

We keep your data while your account is active or as needed to operate the service. You can request deletion at any time.

## Changes

We may update this policy as the service evolves. The latest version will always be posted here.
